## Ethics in the Workplace

I agree this article relates to ethics in technology. As time goes on and more and more people get into the industry it is easier to find people who are willing to ignore what impact the thing they are creating will have. That makes it even more important to set a precendant of standing up for ethical code when you can. Having something like this happen from my work is one of my biggest fears. As someone whose main reason for getting into tech/medicine is to help as many people as possible, writing code that tricks young and impressionable people into taking something that could have severe consequences seems horrific. The quiz this company had made violates many of the tenants of ethics. Just looking above I could see the first three I wrote down were violated.

## Ethics in Technology

This article absolutely relates to ethics. I also agree with this article in the fact that abusing data is getting completely out of hand and is negatively affecting humanity in a number of different ways with much too little resistance. Every time I read about the social credit it seems like a scary story you tell and not actual reality. A spot on example the article gives is how in academics, even the smallest of decision making experients requires approval from a publicly accountable ethics committee and all subjects are required to give their informed consent. While with online data just clicking a simple okay on a pop up is enough.
