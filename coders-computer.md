# Coder's Computer Reading

Text editors are important tools for coding. They allow you to maniuplate and manage text. Some suggested features are code completion, syntax highlighting, variety of themes, and a large variety of useful extensions. A good practice when writing code in a text editor is to set up a file to store all of it for a specific need and to save it as filename.language. 'index.html'.
