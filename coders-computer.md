# Coder's Computer Reading

## Text Editors
Text editors are important tools for coding. They allow you to maniuplate and manage text. Some suggested features are code completion, syntax highlighting, variety of themes, and a large variety of useful extensions. A good practice when writing code in a text editor is to set up a file to store all of it for a specific need and to save it as filename.language. 'index.html'.

## The Command Line

Command lines are also known as terminals. It is a text based interface to the system where you can type commands and recieve outputs back.

## Navigation

We learn about the command pwd which stands for print working directory. It tells you what directory you are currently working in.
ls is the command list. With nothing else it will list what is in your current location. You can also use it with `[options] and [location]`
Next we touch on paths. There are two types. Absolute and relative. Absolute defines a location from the root directory and relative defines it from your current location.
We learn that ~ is the shortcut for the home directory. .(dot) is reference to the current directory, and ..(dotdot) is the parent directory.
cd is the change directory command and helps us move around. `cd[location]`. If none specified it will take you to your home directory.
file is used to what type a certain file or directory is, since everything is a file to a linux system.
ls -a will list the contents of a directory including hidden ones.
