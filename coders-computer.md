# Coder's Computer Reading

## Text Editors
Text editors are important tools for coding. They allow you to maniuplate and manage text. Some suggested features are code completion, syntax highlighting, variety of themes, and a large variety of useful extensions. A good practice when writing code in a text editor is to set up a file to store all of it for a specific need and to save it as filename.language. 'index.html'.

## The Command Line

Command lines are also known as terminals. It is a text based interface to the system where you can type commands and recieve outputs back.

## Navigation

We learn about the command pwd which stands for print working directory. It tells you what directory you are currently working in.
ls is the command list. With nothing else it will list what is in your current location. You can also use it with `[options] and [location]`
