# Reading 9 JS Debugging

## Chapter 10 Error Handling and Debugging

### Summary:
If you understand execution contexts stacks and their two stages, then you are more likely to find the error in your code.
Debugging is the process of finding errors and involves a process of deduction.
The console helps narrow down the area in which the error is located so you can try to find the exact error.
JavaScript has 7 different types of errors. Each creates its own error object, which can tell you its line number and gives a description of the error.
If you know that you may get an error, you can handle it using the **try**, **catch**, and **finally** statements. Use them to give your users helpful feedback.
