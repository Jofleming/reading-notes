# Serverless Functions

## What is Serverless Computing?

[Reading](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/serverless)

Serverless is a cloud execution model that enables a simpler, more cost-effective way to build and operate cloud-native applications.

It automatically provisions the computing resources required to run application code on demand, or in response to a specific event. It automatically scales those resources up or down in response to increased or decreased demand. It automatically scales resources to zero when the application stops running.

Serverless offloads all management responsibility for backend cloud infrastructure and operations tasks - provisioning, scheduling, scaling, patching and more - to the cloud provider. Allows you to focus more on front-end application code or business logic.

Serverless uses FAAS. (Functions As A Service). Functions are run when an event is created (pressing a button or submitting something as an example). It is event driven architecture.
