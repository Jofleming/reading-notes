# Reading 4 HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

# Chapter 4 Links (pp.74-93)

Links are the defining feature of the web as they allow you to move from one web page to another. They take the form of:

`<a href="URL you want to link to">Text that they see/click</a>`

When linking to a page on the same site you do not need to give a full URL. YOu can just link to the html file for it.
If a page has ID tags you can specifically link to those parts of a page instead

`<a href="#givenid">What it is!</a>`

Or make a link that brings up a e-mail with a set e-mail in the to field:

`<a href="mailto:example@email.com">Text explaining</a>`

# Article 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

Pair programming gives greater efficiency. While being able to look at/talk over code, it takes longer initially, but is generally better code that has fewer bugs. When two people are working on the same code it also leads to more engaged work.

It also gives the benefit of students teaching things to one another. Especially in Code Fellows we move so fast. Students grasp different things in different ways, or look into different topics they find interesting. When working together they can share that with each other and expand their own knowledge pools.

It will also help with social skills, work enviornment readiness, and job interview readiness. Pair programming is used in both interviews and in the marketplace. Being comfortable with interacting with, and knowing how to code, another will help you be ready.
