# 301 Reading 13 - Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## That Time When Women Stopped Coding
Questions:
What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?
Personal computers started being sold and were marketed towards men.

Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
Those that had generally had a higher base level of knowledge about them, and college professors assumed everyone had this knowledge and taught around that. This made the barrier to entry even higher for women.

## Employee breakdown of key technology companies
Questions:
What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?
1. Most of the tech industry to this day is still white males.
2. The above trend has not been changing in recent years
3. There is both a huge disparity between women and men in the tech field, and an even bigger one between those that are white and any other ethnicity.


## Why diversity matters to your tech company
Questions:
When are diversity efforts most successful?
When they are driven by a meaningful commitment from company leaders.

Why do diverse companies perform better?
They have stronger teams, since diverse teams have more ways to look at, and solve a problem.

Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or 
vise-versa.
When the employees better represent their users/desired users they will build for those groups more effectively. An example is the soap dispensers that cannot read when a dark skinned person puts their hand under. I will go ahead and take a guess that there were pretty much no non-white members on that team.
