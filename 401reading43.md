# OSS Contributions

## First Timers Only

[Reading](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/)

This reading has a bunch of resources to open source projects that welcome new coders. It talks about how useful starting on an opensource project is.

Angie Gonzalez and Arlene Perez created a GitHub app called [First Timers](https://github.com/apps/first-timers) that automates most of the process of creating first-timers-only issues. Install the app on your repositories and commit simple changes to branches with names starting with first-timers- â€“ the First Timers App will turn it into a fully fledged issue with all information a first-time Open Source contributor will need to make their first pull request.

## What Motivates a Developer to Contribute to Open-Source Software?

[Reading](https://clearcode.cc/blog/why-developers-contribute-open-source-software/)

The main reasons developers contribute to OSS is:

1. Improve Coding Skills
2. Gain Early Experience
3. Increase Community and Peer Recognition
4. Greater Job Prospects
5. Improve Software on a User and Business Level.

OSS projects will include tickets designed for aspiring programs to gain experience. This also has the added benefit of freeing up time for the more experienced programmers to tackle bigger issues. Another important aspect is self-recognition and personal achievement. Many developers are extremely determined to become the best developer they can be to meet certain personal goals, and having your code accepted by a big OSS project is a considered a massive achievement.
