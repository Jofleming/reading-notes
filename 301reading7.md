# Code 301 Reading 7 - REST

## How I explained REST to my brother

Questions:
1. Who is Roy Fielding?
- Some guy. He's smart. He helped write the first web servers. His name is on the specification for the protocol used to get pages from servers to your browser.

2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
- They were not designed for that. Later techniques to get computers to speak to one another were designed around just getting a small group of machines to talk. It says they "don't have a universal noun".

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
- It is about applying verbs to nouns. It is used a lot in browsers trying to GET info.

4. What does a GET do?
- Retrieves data/information.

5. What does a POST do?

6. What does PUT do?
- Replaces something in another system.

7. What does PATCH do?
- Does a partial update on a system.
