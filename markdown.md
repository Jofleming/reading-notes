# Notes on Markdown

Markdown allows the manipulation of text on github. We learned how to make headers with # in various amounts. Bolding or itallics, with ** or * respectively. (Or __ and _ )
Items can be put into various lists. * for unordered. 1 for ordered.
You are also able to show code. You can wrap it in line with `Code Text` , indent with 4 spaces, or have a fully fenced code using three of them.
On Github specifically I was able to upload an imagine and then use it using `![Image Name](Image URL)` with the image name in [] and the image URL in ().
