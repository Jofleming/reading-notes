# Programming with JavaScript

## Expressions and Operators

JS has both binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator called the conditional operator.

Binary requires two operands. One before and one after operator. (3+4 for example. + is the operator)

Unary requires only one and it can be in front or behind.

Assignment operators assign a value to its left operband based on the value of its right operand.

## Control Flow

The order in which a computer executes statements in a script.

Baseline a computer will run from the first line down to the last. This can and often will be changed with conditionals and loops.

## Javascript Functions

### Local Variables
Variables declared **WITHIN** a JS function, become **LOCAL** to the function. Local variables can only be accessed from within that function. 

If you define a variable within a function no code before or after that function can access it.
