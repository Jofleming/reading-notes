I have two dogs, Izaya and Eevee who are helping me get through all of this.

### Growth Mindset to me means
1. **Embracing** struggle as a means of further learning.
2. Using open ended lines of learning/thinking.
3. Using *every* opportunity to grow. The idea of always evolving or moving forward.

### Reminders to myself
- Get pride out of learning. Everyone struggles somewhere. Chase the knowledge, not the feeling of knowing.
- Engage, ask, and explore. Join others in learning and see what you all can create or overcome.
- Don't forget to celebrate your accomplishments. Don't look at where you are compared to others, just that you moved forward at all.
