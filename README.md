# Intro
Hello. I am Jordan, a student at Code Fellows in Seattle, Washington. This page is a repository of all of my reading notes while I progress through CodeFellows. Here is a link to my github portfolio. [My Github](https://github.com/Jofleming)

I have two dogs, Izaya and Eevee who are helping me get through all of this.
