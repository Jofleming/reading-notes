HTML / CSS Images and Text, Git Branching

* HTML / CSS
    * What is Semantic HTML?
        * Element tags ditacte what type of content that SHOULD be there. Not necessarily what is allowed by the browser. It is used to be easy for humans and screen readers.
        * `main` , `article` , `section`, `p`, `figcaptions`, `detail`..etc
        * What is the benefit?
            * Makes it easier for us humans to work on our HTML as a team/edit it.
            * SEO is much better, with semantic tags.
                * This improves searchability, and accessibility
    * What is an HTML Attribute?
        * adding a "style" attribute, adding "src" to an element, add an "ID".
        * An element is being modified, or changed in some way.
        * What are "id"s and "class" attributes used for?
            * To specify an element for our JS and CSS to find and modify given element(s).
        * What about "href" and "src"?
            * They specify a path to an "external reference"
            * hyperlinks, images, JS file, CSS file, ...etc

* JavaScript
    * Primitive Data Types
        * They are the most basic values that can exist in javascript.
        * 5 of them: number, strings, booleans, null, and undefined.
        * These are "immutable".
    * Conditional Logic
        * Rules: if statements, else if statements, else statements.
            * Switch Statements.
        * What is the difference between an `if` and an `else` statement?
            * `if` is an initial statement, and `else` is secondary statement.
                * `else` is like a default rule / the inversion of a logical possibility.
            * `else if`?
                * another `if` statement that is a potential possibility.
            * switch statment?
                * evaluates expressions, matches those to "case" clauses.
                * When one case hits, all others under run as well.
    * Arrays:
        * a variable / data structure that holds values, as many as you want.
    * Loops
        * What is a loop?
            * Used to run a block of code (hopefully) more than once, until a condition is met.
    * Functions
        * What is the benefit of having functions?
            * Code re-usability, code readability, more control, easier to refactor/maintain, lets you give abstraction.
