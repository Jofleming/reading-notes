# What Google Learned About Teams

They spent time trying to find out what made good teams good, and unsuccessful teams such. What they found impacted the teams the most was

* Psychological Safety - If members felt they were safe to engage or be themselves.
* Dependability - If the members were able to trust/lean on other members of the team.
* Structure & Clarity - Having clear structure set up to the group
* Meaning - That their work had purpose.
* Impact - That their work had visible impact.

They found that things that help build teams like this is setting up groups that felt similarly about passions, how much people should talk, how people should joke, etc. Essentially the more the group was 'one the same page' about life in general.
