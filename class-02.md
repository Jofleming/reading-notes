# Class 2 Reading

## Chapter 2 Text (pp. 40-61)

This chapter begins on explaining tags to use to manipulate script.

`<sup> </sup>` is introduced. This marks text as a superscript.
`<sub> </sub>` is also introduced. This marks text as a subscript.

For white space, the browser will read any amount of spaces directly next to each other as one space. It will also do this with a line break. It is called white space collapsing. If you want a break to appear in a certain spot you have to use a new command:

`<br />` - This will add a break in a line when loaded on a page. You can keep typing in line in the actual code.
`<hr />` - This will add a horizontal line across the page. Must sit on its own line in code.

Both of the above are called empty elements. They contain the element and the closing all in one bracket.

`<blockquote> </blockquote>` - This will indent any text in it and make it free floating. Used for longer quotes. You can also cite your sourch in the main tag `<blockquote cite="URL">`
`<q> </q>` - is used for inline quotes. You can also cite in the opening tag.

`<abbr> </abbr>` - Is used for abbreviations. Put the full unabbreviated version in the opening tag so you can see if you mouse over on the actual page. `<abbr title="Non Abbreviated Version">`

`<cite> </cite>` - Used when citing books. Will make it italic.
`<dfn> </dfn>` - Is often used when defining a new term.
`<address> </address>` - Is used to contain contact information. Most browsers will make it italic.
`<ins> </ins>` - Will underline the words. Used to show words inserted into a document.
`<del> </del>` - Will strike a line through the words. Used to show words deleted from a document.
`<s> </s>` - Will strike a line through the text as well. Used to show something is no longer accurate or relevant but that should not be deleted. `<u>` Used to be used to underline but is being phased out.


## Chapter 10 Introducing CSS (pp.226-245)

```
element selector{
    what you are changing: how you are changing it;
}
```
The selector idicates what element(s) you are targeting in your HTML. You can select multiple elements at one time by separating them with a comma. You then on one line specifiy what you are changing about it or the **property** (text type, text color, background color, etc). After the colon you type the **value** you are assigning that (Arial, blue, red, etc).
