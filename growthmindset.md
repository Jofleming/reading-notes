# 401 Growth Mindset

## The Power of Yet

Instead of focusing on failure, the speaker talks about using the "power of yet". This focuses on the idea of growth. That because you cannot do something now, doesn't mean you cannot in the future. The speaker mentions praising and valuing the process of learning/practicing and not talent or intelligence. When you praise growth and process it shows that kids/people will persist through problems more.

## Grit

The speaker talks about how grit is the main thing that helps people be more successful. She explains this is when people focus on a more long term goal, and work steadily towards it.
